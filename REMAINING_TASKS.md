## ðŸŸ¡ Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Recharts SVG Warnings
```
Location: components/roi-timeline.tsx

## ðŸš« Do NOT Do (Warnings from Audit)

These were incorrectly identified in the previous audit:

1. **DO NOT remove share-card.tsx or share-result-card.tsx**
   - They ARE being used in the application

2. **DO NOT remove @vercel/analytics dependency**
   - It IS being used in the analytics system

3. **DO NOT make major architecture changes**
   - Current structure is working well
