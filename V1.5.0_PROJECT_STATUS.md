## 📝 NOTES

The React error #185 was a particularly tricky issue related to how Radix UI's Tooltip component manages refs. The solution of isolating each tooltip with its own provider prevents the ref composition issues that were causing infinite render loops. This is a common pattern when dealing with complex UI libraries that manage their own state.

The project is now in excellent shape for production deployment. All major features are working, tests are passing, and the codebase is clean and well-documented.
