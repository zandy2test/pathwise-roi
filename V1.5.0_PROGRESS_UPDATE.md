## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED:

### **Comparison Card Crash (React Error #185)**

- **Problem:** User clicks comparison cards → "Minified React error #185" crash
- **Documentation Claims:** "Fixed in v1.4.3 with debouncing"
- **Reality:** Still crashes when existing calculations are present
- **Impact:** High priority - breaks core functionality
- **Status:** NEEDS IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION

## 🎯 REMAINING TASKS:

### Priority 1: **Fix Comparison Card Crash**

- [ ] Test live site to reproduce React error #185
- [ ] Identify root cause (state management, async issues)
- [ ] Implement proper fix (not just debouncing)
- [ ] Verify fix works with existing calculations

### Priority 2: **Complete Text Color Fixes**

- [ ] Audit How It Works page for remaining gray-600 text
- [ ] Update all hard-to-read text to gray-800 or darker
- [ ] Test readability on various backgrounds

### Priority 3: **Verify All Fixes Live**

- [ ] Test new testimonials are showing
- [ ] Test email modal layout is compact
- [ ] Test version numbers display v1.5.0
- [ ] Test comparison cards don't crash

## 📊 TECHNICAL STATUS:

- ✅ **Tests:** 76/76 passing (though run too often via git hooks)
- ✅ **Build:** Production ready
- ✅ **ESLint:** No warnings
- 🔄 **Deployment:** In progress
- ❌ **Critical Bug:** Comparison crash still exists

## 📝 NOTES:

**Git Hooks:** Tests run automatically on every commit via husky + lint-staged. This causes all 76 tests to run even for simple UI fixes, which is overkill but ensures no regressions.

**Next Focus:** Once deployment completes, test the comparison card crash with real user behavior to identify the actual cause and implement a proper fix.
