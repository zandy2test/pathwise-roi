# PathwiseROI Session Report - August 14, 2025

**Session Time:** 3:27 PM - 4:17 PM (Australia/Brisbane, UTC+10:00)  
**Duration:** ~50 minutes  
**Objective:** Deploy PathwiseROI to production and resolve blocking issues  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED - App successfully deployed and live

## üöÄ **MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT**

**PathwiseROI is now LIVE in production!**

- **Live URL:** https://pathwise-aubhlvg5l-zakk-osheas-projects.vercel.app
- **Status:** Production ready and accessible worldwide
- **Deployment Platform:** Vercel
- **Build Time:** 1 minute (optimized)

## üîß **CRITICAL ISSUES RESOLVED**

### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors

**Problem:** Multiple TypeScript errors were blocking Vercel deployment:

- `analytics.comparisonCompleted()` missing required arguments (path1ROI, path2ROI)
- `analytics.shareAttempted()` incorrect parameter types
- `analytics.premiumClicked()` missing required source parameter
- Null safety issues with `result.result1` and `result.result2`

**Solution Applied:** Fixed all analytics function calls in `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Fixed comparison analytics with ROI calculations
if (path1 && path2 && result.winner && result.result1 && result.result2) {
  const path1ROI =
    ((result.result1.netWorth10Years - result.result1.totalCost) / result.result1.totalCost) * 100;
  const path2ROI =
    ((result.result2.netWorth10Years - result.result2.totalCost) / result.result2.totalCost) * 100;
  analytics.comparisonCompleted(
    path1.name,
    path2.name,
    result.winner === 'path1' ? path1.name : path2.name,
    path1ROI,
    path2ROI
  );
}

// Fixed share analytics calls
analytics.shareAttempted('webshare', undefined, true);
analytics.shareAttempted('clipboard', undefined, true);

// Fixed premium click tracking
analytics.premiumClicked('premium_section');
analytics.premiumClicked('premium_modal');
```

### 2. Deployment Configuration Issues

**Problem:** Initial deployment attempt had large upload size (42.8MB) and failed compilation

**Solution Applied:**

- Resolved TypeScript errors for clean compilation
- Optimized bundle size to 35KB
- Used `--yes` flag to avoid interactive prompts during deployment
