# Husky v9 Migration Fix - August 16, 2025

## Problem Identified

When attempting to commit locally, a large error message appeared with "HUSKY DEPRECATED" warning, preventing commits from completing successfully.

### Error Message Details

```
husky - DEPRECATED

Please remove the following two lines from .husky/pre-commit:

#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

They WILL FAIL in v10.0.0
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The project was using Husky v8 configuration format which became deprecated in Husky v9. The `.husky/pre-commit` file contained:

1. Shebang line: `#!/usr/bin/env sh`
2. Source line: `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"`

These lines were required in Husky v8 but are deprecated in v9 and will completely fail in v10.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `.husky/pre-commit` File

**Before (Husky v8 format):**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
npm test
```

**After (Husky v9 format):**

```bash
npx lint-staged
npm test
```

### 2. Verification

Successfully tested the fix with a commit that:

- Ran lint-staged successfully
- Executed all tests
- Completed without deprecation warnings

## Test Results

All tests passing:

```
PASS __tests__/App.test.tsx
PASS __tests__/validation.test.ts
PASS __tests__/calculator.test.ts
PASS __tests__/components/PathBuilder.test.tsx
PASS __tests__/components/ShareResultCard.test.tsx
PASS __tests__/components/ROITimeline.test.tsx

Test Suites: 6 passed, 6 total
Tests:       76 passed, 76 total
```

## Known Non-Critical Warnings

### 1. React Test Warnings

These warnings appear in tests but don't affect functionality:

- SVG linearGradient casing warning (React DOM property name convention)
- React act() warnings in some component tests
- These are test-environment specific and don't affect production

### 2. MCP Settings Warning

- "Invalid MCP settings format" appears in Cline/VS Code
- Unrelated to Husky - this is about MCP server configuration
- MCP servers still function correctly

## Migration Impact

- **Breaking Changes**: None
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained
- **CI/CD**: No changes required
- **Developer Experience**: Improved - no more deprecation warnings

## Future Considerations

1. When Husky v10 releases, this migration is mandatory (not optional)
2. The current configuration is fully compatible with Husky v9
3. Pre-commit hooks continue to enforce code quality via lint-staged
4. All tests run before commits to prevent broken code

## Related Files

- `.husky/pre-commit` - Updated to v9 format
- `package.json` - Husky configuration remains unchanged
- `.lintstagedrc` or lint-staged config in package.json - Still functional

## Commands for Verification

```bash
# Test pre-commit hook
git add .
git commit -m "test: verify Husky v9 migration"

# Manual hook execution
.husky/pre-commit
```
