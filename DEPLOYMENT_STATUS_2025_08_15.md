## Important Notes

### What's NOT Deployed

- **Dark theme** (exists in `app/page-redesign.tsx` but not active)
- **Premium components** from `/components/premium/` (created but unused)
- **Payment processing** for premium features
- **Complete analytics** implementation

### Clarification on Confusion

Previous documentation incorrectly stated that a dark theme with glass morphism was deployed. This is **NOT TRUE**. The production site uses a light theme with Scam Score™ branding.

### Files to Reference

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Single source of truth
- `app/page.tsx` - Current homepage (light theme)
- `app/page-redesign.tsx` - Unused dark theme prototype

## Next Deployment Priorities

1. Complete analytics implementation
2. Add E2E testing with Playwright
3. Performance monitoring (Sentry)
4. Consider A/B testing light vs dark theme
