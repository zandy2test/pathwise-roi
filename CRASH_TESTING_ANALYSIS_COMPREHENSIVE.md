# üîç Crash Testing Analysis - Why I Couldn't Reproduce the Crash

## Task Context
**User Request**: Analyze the Gemini review about crash problems and test if the application can still be crashed.

**Gemini Review Key Points**:
- Application crashes when user clicks "Compare with Another Path" button
- Root cause: 401 Unauthorized error from POST to `/api/trpc/collection.create`  
- Results in "Minified React error #310" and error boundary screen

## My Testing Approach (What I Actually Did)

### Test Setup
- Used Playwright automation to access `http://localhost:3000`
- Filled out scam score calculation form
- Located elements containing "Click to see comparison ‚Üí" text
- Performed 3 phases of aggressive clicking

### Test Results
- **Phase 1**: 10 clicks at 50ms intervals - No crashes
- **Phase 2**: 25 clicks at 10ms intervals - No crashes  
- **Phase 3**: 25 clicks across 5 elements at 5ms intervals - No crashes
- **Total**: 60+ rapid clicks with zero crashes or errors

## Critical Analysis - What I Likely Missed

### 1. Wrong Target Elements
**What I clicked**: `<p>` elements with "Click to see comparison ‚Üí" text
**What I should have clicked**: Actual button elements that trigger the tRPC API call

### 2. Missing Authentication Context
**Gemini Review States**: The crash happens for "unauthenticated users"
**My Testing**: May have been in an authenticated session or wrong session state

### 3. Wrong API Endpoint Focus
**Expected Crash Flow**:
1. User clicks "Compare with Another Path" button
2. Frontend makes POST to `/api/trpc/collection.create?batch=1`
3. Server returns 401 Unauthorized (user not authenticated)
4. Frontend lacks proper error handling
5. React crashes with "Minified React error #310"

**My Testing**: Focused on UI clicking without monitoring API calls

## Evidence from Screenshots
- `initial-site-state-2025-08-18T17-39-37-979Z.png`: Shows the calculated scam score page
- `comparison-cards-view-2025-08-18T17-40-13-558Z.png`: Shows the comparison cards I was clicking

## Revised Testing Protocol Needed

### 1. Correct Element Identification
- Find actual "Compare with Another Path" button (not text links)
- Use browser dev tools to identify the element that triggers tRPC calls
- Look for button elements with click handlers that make API requests

### 2. Authentication State Testing  
- Test in incognito/private browsing mode (guaranteed unauthenticated)
- Clear all cookies/session storage before testing
- Monitor network requests to confirm 401 responses

### 3. API Call Monitoring
- Watch network tab for POST requests to `/api/trpc/collection.create`
- Confirm 401 Unauthorized responses are occurring
- Monitor console for React error messages

### 4. Error Boundary Testing
- Look for React error boundary activation
- Check for "Minified React error #310" specifically
- Verify if error boundary shows "Oops! Something went wrong" page

## Conclusion
My testing was thorough in terms of volume (60+ clicks) but likely targeted the wrong UI elements and missed the specific authentication/API error conditions that trigger the crash described in the Gemini review.

## Next Steps Required
1. **Re-test with proper element targeting**: Find the actual tRPC-triggering button
2. **Test in unauthenticated state**: Use incognito mode or cleared session
3. **Monitor API calls**: Watch for 401 responses to collection.create endpoint
4. **Verify crash conditions**: Confirm React error #310 and error boundary behavior

## User Action Needed
To properly complete this crash testing, I need to:
1. Launch a new browser session in the correct unauthenticated state
2. Identify the exact button/element that triggers the tRPC collection.create API call
3. Monitor both UI behavior and network requests during clicking
4. Document any crashes or 401 errors that occur

**Status**: Testing was incomplete - need to retry with correct methodology.
