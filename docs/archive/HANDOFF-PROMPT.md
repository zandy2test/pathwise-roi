# PathwiseROI Project Continuation - Context & Current State

## Project Overview
I'm working on **PathwiseROI**, an education ROI calculator web application that helps students and parents calculate when their education investment pays off. The project is located at `c:/Dev/projects/Project_7_PathwiseROI` and uses Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

**GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/zandy2test/pathwise-roi.git

## Recent Major Refactor Completed (January 8, 2025)
A comprehensive refactor was just completed that transformed the application from a multi-page structure to a single-page application. Key changes include:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
1. **Single-Page Architecture** - All functionality now in `app/page.tsx` with 3 modes (intro/calculator/compare)
2. **Timeline Visualization** - Interactive 10-year ROI graphs using Recharts (`components/roi-timeline.tsx`)
3. **Share Cards** - Canvas-generated social media cards (1200x630px) with download/share (`components/share-card.tsx`)
4. **Working Share Functionality** - Web Share API + clipboard fallback
5. **Premium Modal** - UI for $9.99/month upgrade (payment integration pending)
6. **Analytics System** - Comprehensive tracking in `lib/analytics.ts`
7. **Footer Pages Created** - Privacy, Terms, How It Works pages all working
8. **PathBuilder Component** - Reusable form component eliminating code duplication
9. **Scholarship Validation** - $100k maximum limit enforced
10. **Quick Comparisons** - Viral comparison cards now functional

### üìä Current Application State
- **Status:** Feature-complete MVP, production-ready (except payment integration)
- **Architecture:** Single-page application with smooth mode transitions
- **Data:** 20 education paths, 30+ locations, school tiers
- **Calculations:** ROI breakeven, 10-year projections, comparison winner logic
- **Visual:** Timeline graphs, share cards, tooltips, responsive design

## üî¥ LIVE APPLICATION URL
**The application is currently running at: http://localhost:3008**
(Note: Running on port 3008 as ports 3000-3007 were in use)

## To Run & Test the Application

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd c:/Dev/projects/Project_7_PathwiseROI

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
```

**Access at:** http://localhost:3008

## üìã Immediate Next Steps Needed

### 1. **User Testing & Feedback Collection**
- Use `FEEDBACK-TEMPLATE.md` to collect user feedback on:
  - Timeline graph accuracy and clarity
  - Share card functionality and visual appeal
  - Premium modal conversion potential
  - Single-page flow experience
  - Mobile responsiveness
  - New features (tooltips, quick comparisons)

### 2. **High Priority Fixes**
- [ ] **Payment Integration** - Currently shows alert(), needs Stripe/PayPal
- [ ] **Google Analytics** - Set up GA4 property and add tracking ID
- [ ] **Error Boundaries** - Add error handling for production
- [ ] **Loading States** - Improve transition animations

### 3. **Content & Data Expansion**
- [ ] Expand from 20 to 50+ education paths as originally planned
- [ ] Add more location options
- [ ] Update SEO metadata for single-page structure

### 4. **Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel (config ready in `vercel.json`)
- [ ] Set up environment variables for analytics
- [ ] Configure custom domain if available

## üìÅ Key Files to Review
- `REFACTORING-LOG.md` - Complete history of changes made
- `CURRENT-STATE.md` - Detailed current state documentation
- `FEEDBACK-TEMPLATE.md` - Template for collecting user feedback
- `app/page.tsx` - Main application file with all modes
- `components/roi-timeline.tsx` - Timeline graph component
- `components/share-card.tsx` - Social share card generator
- `lib/analytics.ts` - Analytics implementation

## Known Issues & Limitations
1. Payment shows alert() instead of real payment flow
2. Only 20 education paths (not 50+ as documentation claims)
3. No error boundaries or advanced loading states
4. GA4 not configured for production
5. Share functionality requires HTTPS for native sharing

## Testing Focus Areas
1. **Calculator Mode:** Test ROI calculations, scholarship validation, tooltips
2. **Timeline Graphs:** Check breakeven visualization, 10-year projections
3. **Compare Mode:** Test side-by-side comparisons, winner determination
4. **Share Cards:** Test download/share functionality on different devices
5. **Premium Modal:** Review pricing and feature presentation
6. **Footer Pages:** Verify all legal pages load correctly

## Questions to Answer
- Is the single-page experience smooth and intuitive?
- Are the timeline graphs clear and helpful?
- Would users actually share the generated cards on social media?
- Is the $9.99/month premium pricing appropriate?
- What education paths are missing that users need?

## Git Status
The following files have been modified or added during the refactor:
- Modified: README.md (updated with new features)
- Deleted: app/calculate/page.tsx, app/compare/page.tsx (old routes)
- Modified: app/page.tsx (now single-page app)
- Added: components/path-builder.tsx, components/roi-timeline.tsx, components/share-card.tsx
- Added: app/privacy/page.tsx, app/terms/page.tsx, app/how-it-works/page.tsx
- Modified: lib/validation.ts (scholarship limit)
- Added: lib/analytics.ts (tracking system)
- Modified: components/footer.tsx (fixed links)
- Modified: package.json (updated dependencies)

Please test the application thoroughly at **http://localhost:3008** and provide feedback using the template. Focus especially on the new features (timeline graphs, share cards, premium modal) as these haven't been user-tested yet.
