# RUNNING AUDITS FOR BOTH PROJECTS

## Quick Instructions

### For Project_7_PathwiseROI:
1. Open a new AI terminal (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
2. Navigate to: `cd C:\Dev\projects\Project_7_PathwiseROI`
3. Copy everything from `goldilocks-framework-v1.7.md` starting from **"## TECHNICAL AUDIT FRAMEWORK - IMMEDIATE EXECUTION"** to the end
4. Paste into the AI terminal
5. The AI will execute all stages automatically (~45-90 minutes)

### For Project_8_Pressure_Point_MVP:
1. Open another AI terminal
2. Navigate to: `cd C:\Dev\projects\Project_8_Pressure_Point_MVP`
3. Copy the same prompt from `goldilocks-framework-v1.7.md`
4. Paste into the AI terminal
5. Let it run in parallel with the other audit

## What to Copy

Open `C:\Dev\projects\Project_9_Goldilocks_Audit\goldilocks-framework-v1.7.md`

Copy everything from this line:
```
## TECHNICAL AUDIT FRAMEWORK - IMMEDIATE EXECUTION
```
All the way to the end of the file.

## Expected Timeline

Each audit will take 45-90 minutes and will:
- Stage 0: Environment Detection (2-3 min)
- Stage 1: Foundation Analysis (10-15 min)
- Stage 2: Build & Test Verification (10-15 min)
- Stage 3: Code Quality & Linting (5-10 min)
- Stage 4: Security Scanning (10-15 min)
- Stage 5: Configuration Analysis (5-10 min)
- Stage 6: Report Generation (5 min)

## Output

Each audit will generate:
- `TECHNICAL_AUDIT_YYYY_MM_DD.md` in the project directory
- Real findings with [TESTED], [ANALYZED], [INFERRED] evidence labels
- Priority-classified issues (P1-P4)

## Notes

- This is the ASCII-safe version (v1.7.1) - no encoding issues
- Uses the prompt-based approach that's been proven reliable
- Each AI will adapt to what it finds in real-time
- Much more thorough than the PowerShell script attempts

Ready to go! Just copy and paste into your AI terminals.
