Website Crash Analysis & Fix Plan: collegescam.io
1. Executive Summary 📝
The application crashes when a user, who is likely not authenticated, clicks the "Compare with Another Path" button after getting an initial "Scam Score."

The root cause is a 401 Unauthorized error from a POST request to your tRPC API endpoint (/api/trpc/collection.create). The React frontend does not handle this API error gracefully, causing it to crash and display a generic error boundary screen.

2. Diagnosis 🩺
I've broken down the sequence of events leading to the crash:

User Action: The user fills out the "Calculate Your Scam Score" form and gets a result.

Trigger: The user clicks the "Compare with Another Path" button.

API Request: This action triggers a POST request to https://www.collegescam.io/api/trpc/collection.create?batch=1.

API Response: The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code. This means the server is refusing to complete the request because the user lacks valid authentication credentials.

Frontend Crash: The frontend code that made the API call does not have logic to handle a 401 error. It likely expected a successful response with data. When it receives an error instead, it tries to render a component with missing or invalid data, leading to a React rendering error (Minified React error #310). This unhandled error is caught by a top-level error boundary, which then displays the "Oops! Something went wrong" page.

3. Recommended Fixes 🛠️
The fix requires changes on the frontend to improve user experience and error handling. The backend is likely behaving as intended by protecting the endpoint.

High Priority: Frontend Fixes
The primary goal is to prevent the application from crashing and to provide a clear user experience.

Step 1: Implement Graceful API Error Handling
Your code that calls the collection.create tRPC mutation needs to properly handle potential errors. Instead of letting the error crash the app, you should catch it.

Example (using React Query/tRPC):

JavaScript

// This is a conceptual example of how you might be calling your mutation.
const createComparison = trpc.collection.create.useMutation({
  // On success, do something...
  onSuccess: (data) => {
    console.log("Comparison created!", data);
    // Proceed with showing the comparison UI
  },
  // 👇 THIS IS THE CRITICAL PART TO ADD 👇
  onError: (error) => {
    // Check if the error is a 401 Unauthorized error
    if (error.data?.httpStatus === 401) {
      // Trigger a login modal or redirect to the login page
      console.error("User is not authenticated. Prompting for login.");
      // Example: showLoginModal(true);
      // Or display a toast notification
      // toast.error("Please sign in to compare results.");
    } else {
      // Handle other types of server/network errors
      console.error("An unexpected error occurred:", error);
      // toast.error("Something went wrong. Please try again.");
    }
  },
});

// When the button is clicked, you call the mutation
const handleCompareClick = () => {
  createComparison.mutate({ /* payload here */ });
};
Step 2: Improve the User Experience (UX)
Crashing is a bad user experience. Based on the fact that the endpoint requires authentication, you have two main options:

"Public" vs. "Private" Features (Recommended):

For Logged-Out Users: Disable the "Compare with Another Path" button. You can add a tooltip that says, "Sign up to save and compare results!" This encourages user registration and clearly communicates the feature's requirements.

For Logged-In Users: Keep the button enabled as it currently is.

Prompt Login on Click:

Keep the button enabled for all users.

When a logged-out user clicks it, instead of trying to make the API call, open a Login/Sign Up modal.

After the user successfully signs in, you can either automatically trigger the comparison action or let them click the button again.

Low Priority: Backend Review
The backend is likely working correctly by design, but it's worth a quick review.

Confirm Intent: Double-check with your backend team that the /api/trpc/collection.create endpoint is intended to be a protected route. If it is, no changes are needed. If it's supposed to be public, then the authentication middleware needs to be removed from that specific endpoint.

Consistent API Responses: Ensure that all protected endpoints consistently return a 401 Unauthorized status code when an unauthenticated request is made.

By implementing robust error handling and a clearer UX on the frontend, you'll not only fix this crash but also create a more intuitive and resilient application.
