## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### E2E Tests Need Complete Rewrite
**Problem:** The E2E tests were written for an older version of the application and are failing because:

1. **Changed Page Structure:**
   - Main page title changed from "PathwiseROI" to "The $200,000 Question: Is College Worth It?"
   - Calculator integrated into home page (/) instead of separate /calculate page
   - Different navigation structure

2. **Different Content:**
   - Button text changed (e.g., "Calculate My Scam Score‚Ñ¢" instead of "Calculate Your ROI")
   - Validation messages changed
   - No separate header/footer structure

3. **Test Failures:**
   - 30+ failing tests across all browsers
   - Timeouts waiting for elements that don't exist
   - Wrong page expectations

### E2E Test Rewrite Requirements

**Navigation Tests Need:**
- Update home page title expectations
- Fix button text selectors
- Update URL structure (calculator is on / not /calculate)

**Calculator Tests Need:**
- Update form selectors to match current PathBuilder component
- Fix validation message expectations
- Update success state expectations

**Mobile Tests Need:**
- Update responsive breakpoint tests
- Fix touch interaction tests

**Sharing Tests Need:**
- Update sharing component selectors
- Fix share card generation tests
