## 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Domain Not Working?

- **Check DNS propagation**: https://dnschecker.org - enter collegescam.io
- **Common issue**: Some registrars need "forwarding" disabled
- **Wait time**: DNS can take up to 48 hours (usually 5-30 minutes)

### Email Capture Not Working?

- **Check logs**: Vercel Dashboard > Functions > api/waitlist > Logs
- **Test locally first**: Make sure it works at localhost:3000
- **Check console**: Browser DevTools > Console for errors

### Analytics Not Showing?

- **GA4**: Can take 24-48 hours for full data
- **Vercel**: Needs multiple visits to show data
- **Ad blockers**: Disable them when testing

### Admin Page Shows Unauthorized?

- **Check URL**: Make sure `?secret=` matches your ADMIN_SECRET exactly
- **Case sensitive**: Password must match exactly
- **No spaces**: Don't add spaces before/after password
