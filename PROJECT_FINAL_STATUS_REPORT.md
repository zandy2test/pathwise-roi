## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Non-Blocking)

### 1. E2E Tests Need Updating
**Status**: Infrastructure complete, tests need refactoring  
**Impact**: Does not affect core functionality  
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours for complete test suite update  

**Details**: E2E tests were written for older app structure and need updating to match current viral landing page format. Unit tests cover all functionality.

### 2. Expected Console Warnings
**Status**: Normal library behavior  
**Impact**: No functional impact  
**Action**: No action needed  

**Details**: 
- Recharts SVG warnings (library-specific, doesn't affect charts)
- React Act warnings in tests (async state updates, expected behavior)
