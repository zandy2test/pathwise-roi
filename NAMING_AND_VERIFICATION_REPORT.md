## PART 2: ACTUAL VERIFICATION METHODS

### What I Can Actually Verify:

#### 1. Code Changes (via Git)

```bash
# Check actual code changes made
git diff HEAD~5 app/page.tsx
git diff HEAD~5 components/path-builder.tsx
git log --oneline -10
```

#### 2. Test Suite Results

```bash
# Run actual tests
npm test
# Output: Test Suites: X passed, X total
# Tests: X passed, X total
```

#### 3. Build Verification

```bash
# Check if build succeeds
npm run build
# Output: Build successful/failed with specific errors
```

#### 4. TypeScript Compilation

```bash
# Check for type errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### What I CANNOT Verify:

1. **Visual Appearance** - I cannot see screenshots or verify visual styling
2. **Browser Rendering** - I cannot confirm how things actually look
3. **User Experience** - I cannot test actual user interactions
4. **Color Accuracy** - I cannot verify if colors are displaying correctly
5. **Layout Issues** - I cannot see spacing, alignment, or responsive behavior

### Actual Verification Evidence Available:

#### From Git History:

```bash
# Recent commits showing changes
git log --oneline -5
5b889b4 docs: update project context with single-page refactor completion
bf0b077 fix: complete single-page refactor with all issues resolved
97ee3e8 chore: cleanup outdated documentation and temporary files
```

#### From Code Review:

1. **Calculator Labels** - Can verify `className="text-gray-900"` exists in code
2. **Text Changes** - Can verify string replacements in source files
3. **Component Structure** - Can verify file organization and imports
4. **Function Logic** - Can verify calculation logic via unit tests

#### From Build Output:

- Compilation success/failure
- Module count and bundle size
- TypeScript errors if any
- Linting warnings

## PART 3: HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What Was Actually Done:

1. **Code reviewed** - Checked source files for mentioned changes
2. **Tests run** - Unit tests passing (76 tests)
3. **Build verified** - Next.js build succeeds
4. **Dev server checked** - Running on port 3000

### What Was NOT Done:

1. **No screenshots taken** - The mentioned screenshots don't exist
2. **No visual verification** - Cannot see actual UI
3. **No user testing** - No actual interaction testing
4. **No browser testing** - Only code-level verification

### Recommended Verification Steps:

1. Manually check the site at http://localhost:3000
2. Take actual screenshots for comparison
3. Test each feature manually
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Test on different screen sizes
6. Verify colors and contrast

## PART 4: NEXT STEPS

### For Naming/Text Changes:

1. Review the options above
2. Select preferred variations
3. We can A/B test different options
4. Implement chosen text

### For Proper Verification:

1. You should manually verify the UI
2. Take screenshots of issues you see
3. Provide specific feedback on problems
4. I can then fix actual code issues

### Questions for You:

1. Which naming options resonate most?
2. What specific visual issues do you see?
3. Which features need priority fixes?
4. Should we implement A/B testing for text variations?
