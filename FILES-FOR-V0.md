# Files to Give V0 for Building PathwiseROI MVP

## Essential Files to Upload to V0

### 1. Core Planning Documents
- `pathwise-roi-masterplan-FINAL.md` - Complete vision and requirements
- `implementation-plan.md` - Technical specifications
- `app-flow-and-pages.md` - User flows and page details
- `design-guidelines.md` - UI/UX specifications

### 2. Data & Logic
- `data-structure-consolidated.json` - All calculations and data models

### 3. Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Dependencies list
- `.env.example` - Environment variables template

### 4. Reference Implementation
Upload these files from temp-v0-repo as working examples:
- `temp-v0-repo/components/calculator-page-client.tsx`
- `temp-v0-repo/components/compare-paths.tsx`
- `temp-v0-repo/components/footer.tsx`
- `temp-v0-repo/lib/calculator.ts`
- `temp-v0-repo/lib/validation.ts`
- `temp-v0-repo/app/layout.tsx`

### 5. Build Instructions
- `V0-COMPLETE-BUILD-PACKAGE.md` - The comprehensive instructions

## Instructions to Give V0

"Build the complete PathwiseROI MVP based on these documents. This is an education ROI calculator that shows students when their education investment pays off. 

Key requirements:
1. Implement all pages: landing, calculator, compare
2. Use Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
3. Include all calculations from data-structure-consolidated.json
4. Make it production-ready
5. Push directly to https://github.com/zandy2test/pathwise-roi.git main branch

The app should be fully functional with working calculator, comparison tool, and all validations. Focus on making it work correctly rather than perfect - I'll review and polish after you push."

## Why This Approach Works

1. **V0 gets complete context** - All planning docs ensure V0 understands the vision
2. **Working examples** - The temp-v0-repo files show proven patterns
3. **Clear data structure** - The JSON file has all calculation logic
4. **Defined scope** - V0 knows exactly what to build
5. **Review process** - You can audit and improve after V0 delivers

## After V0 Builds

I'll be able to:
- Pull the latest from main branch
- Review the complete implementation
- Fix any issues or bugs
- Add optimizations
- Enhance UX details
- Ensure production readiness
- Deploy to Vercel

This division of labor is perfect - V0 handles the heavy lifting of initial implementation, and I handle refinement and deployment.
