# API Keys Security Analysis - MCP Settings

## Current Situation

**File**: `cline_mcp_settings.json`
**Location**: Local VS Code settings (AppData)
**Contains**: API keys for Firecrawl, Supabase, ElevenLabs, etc.

## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ SAFE - They're NOT exposed in deployment

**Why it's safe:**

- **Local only**: The file is in your VS Code AppData folder
- **Not in project**: It's NOT part of your project files
- **Not deployed**: Never gets pushed to GitHub or Vercel
- **Not accessible**: Website visitors cannot access these

### Who can see them:

1. **You** (on your local machine)
2. **Anyone with physical/remote access to your computer**
3. **Malware on your system** (if compromised)

### Who CANNOT see them:

1. **Website visitors** ‚ùå
2. **GitHub users** ‚ùå (not in repository)
3. **Vercel deployment** ‚ùå (not included)
4. **Other developers** ‚ùå (unless they access your machine)

## Risk Level: LOW

### Why:

- These are development tools for YOUR use
- They help Claude/Cline assist you better
- They're not production secrets
- They're not included in your deployed application

## Best Practices

### Current Status: ‚úÖ Acceptable

You're already following good practices:

- Keys are local only
- Not committed to Git
- Not in project directory
- Using .env.example for actual project secrets

### Optional Improvements (if paranoid):

1. **Rotate periodically** (every 3-6 months)
2. **Use environment variables** instead:

   ```json
   "env": {
     "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "${FIRECRAWL_KEY}"
   }
   ```

   Then set in system environment

3. **Monitor usage** on provider dashboards
4. **Set spending limits** where possible

## Bottom Line

**These API keys are NOT a deployment risk.** They're local development tools that make your AI assistants more capable. The website deployment has zero access to them.

The only risk is if someone gains access to your local machine, which is a bigger problem than just API keys.

## Recommendation

‚úÖ **Keep as-is** - Current setup is fine for development
‚ö†Ô∏è **Optional**: Rotate keys every few months for hygiene
üö´ **Don't worry** about deployment exposure - it won't happen
